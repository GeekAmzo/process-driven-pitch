# Why This Is Stronger

1. Revenue starts early
2. Investor risk decreases
3. Founder pressure aligned with growth
4. Build is validated continuously
5. Valuation conversation becomes real by Month 3

---

# What This Requires From You

* Selling from Week 2
* Direct founder-led onboarding
* Vertical focus (do not go broad)
* Aggressive case study building
* Strict feature prioritization

---

# Critical Strategic Move

Choose one primary vertical for the first 90 days and execute deeply.

Recommended starting focus:

* Agencies
* Digital marketing firms
* Consulting firms
* E-commerce stores

Reason: early traction requires repeatable delivery, fast case studies, and tighter messaging. Going too broad slows Month 2 revenue proof.
